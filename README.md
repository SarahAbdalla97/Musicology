# Musicology
The corpus I have chosen includes two different playlists. One playlist is made to be a study playlist, that would include music that is supposed to let you have a great focus in order to be studying well. The other playlist would be a 'normal' playlist, one that is not made for music to put on while studying, or for when you want to increase your focus. I chose it because I always try to use study playlists when I realize that I am having a bit of trouble trying to stay focused while studying. I want to find out through research whether there would be a measurable difference between the two different playlists. I think what is very interesting about this research, would be to find out what is the exact thing that makes you feel more focused, rather than when you would listen to a 'normal' playlist that is not seen as a studying playlist.
